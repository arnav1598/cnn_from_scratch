# About
A simple CNN implemented from scratch in Python using only numpy. The network consists of a convolutional layer followed by a max-pooling layer followed by a dense layer with softmax activation function to get probabilities. The network is trained on MNIST training set and then evaluated on MNIST testing set.

Achieved 97.4% test accuracy with this simple CNN!
